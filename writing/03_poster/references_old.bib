@inproceedings{Zhang2004,
  abstract = {Naive Bayes is one of the most efficient and effective inductive learning
	algorithms for machine learning and data mining. Its competitive
	performance in classification is surprising, because the conditional
	independence assumption on which it is based, is rarely true in realworld
	applications. An open question is: what is the true reason for the
	surprisingly good performance of naive Bayes in classification? In
	this paper, we propose a novel explanation on the superb classification
	performance of naive Bayes. We show that, essentially, the dependence
	distribution; i.e., how the local dependence of a node distributes
	in each class, evenly or unevenly, and how the local dependencies
	of all nodes work together, consistently (supporting a certain classification)
	or inconsistently (canceling each other out), plays a crucial role.
	Therefore, no matter how strong the dependences among attributes
	are, naive Bayes can still be optimal if the dependences distribute
	evenly in classes, or if the dependences cancel each other out. We
	propose and prove a sufficient and necessary conditions for the optimality
	of naive Bayes. Further, we investigate the optimality of naive Bayes
	under the Gaussian distribution. We present and prove a sufficient
	condition for the optimality of naive Bayes, in which the dependence
	between attributes do exist. This provides evidence that dependence
	among attributes may cancel out each other. In addition, we explore
	when naive Bayes works well.},
