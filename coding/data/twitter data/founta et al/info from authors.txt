You can find attached two CSV files with the data. The first (hatespeech_id_label.csv) is the original file you can also get from the GitHub repository. This file contains two columns, the Tweet IDs and their associated labels. The second file (hatespeech_text_label_vote.csv) is a tab-separated CSV, and its format is: Text - Majority Label - Votes of the majority label. The rows on the file I'm sending you are shuffled so there is no connection between tweet IDs and texts (in order to be aligned with the T&C of Twitter).
